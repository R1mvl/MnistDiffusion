# Number Generator with Deep Dynamic Probabilistic Model (DDPM)

## Overview

This repository contains code for a Streamlit web application that generates handwritten digits using a trained Deep Dynamic Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with a Context Unet architecture. The generated digits are based on user-input numbers, allowing users to interactively explore the model's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Models

The results directory contains the trained models used by the application. The ContextUnet and DDPM models are loaded during the execution of the app to generate digit samples.
